<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>
By choosing a career in librarianship, I have chosen a service profession. My fieldwork experiences have proven to me that as much as I enjoy research and the hunt for information, I enjoy helping people even more. Sometimes helping a patron can be easy and somewhat superficial, like pointing out a bestseller display. Other times, though, providing assistance requires a bit more personal interaction and certainly more understanding from the librarian. A senior citizen may require easy-to-read signage, while children need shelves made to fit their small statures. Libraries in diverse communities should bolster their "other language" collections to appeal to non-English readers, and librarians should be aware of the different physical and verbal cues that are acceptable in other cultures. Internet access, entertainment materials or even homework assistance are considered luxury expenses to some patrons, and they will turn to their library to offset these costs, just as <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/torontocouncil/article/1032536--video-teen-surprised-by-reaction-to-speech?bn=1" target="_blank">one young girl explains here</a>. If I am not able to recognize the social, cultural and economic factors that bring patrons to my library, I may fail to provide them with the service they need.
</p>


<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>My first piece of evidence is a discussion post I wrote for LIBR 210: Reference and Information Services. The prompt asked us to consider what programs should be offered to senior patrons aside from the ever-present computer classes. My reflection on this topic led me to discover just how important it is to consider the needs of your users, and in this case, the social factors that impact their information use. I recognized that print collections are not the only aspect that should be affected by the age of the user. Senior patrons certainly use print materials for their information needs, but they also enjoy the in-person interaction provided by library special events. If I were reflecting on  this topic today, I would suggest that libraries should consider ways to help senior patrons with social networking. It is unfair to assume that seniors are unfamiliar with computers these days, and in fact, many older patrons want to be active on popular social networks and photo sharing websites. Teaching them how to use these tools and giving them topics to debate and reasons to assemble (online or in-person) would be two great extensions to the typical services provided to senior-aged patrons.
</p>

<p>
The second piece of evidence, an essay written for LIBR 200: Information and Society, addresses the topic of recruiting a more diverse pool of library school students. I believe libraries need to start addressing the specific needs of their multicultured patron base. One of the absolute best ways to do this is to have a staff that can understand cultural nuances and speak languages and dialects other than English. I learned that there is a movement to train existing librarians about cultural awareness, but only so much can be learned from reading a book or watching a presentation. If we are to encourage our patrons to feel comfortable in our libraries, we must embrace their diversity within our own ranks. Knowing what I do now, I would not change my essay, but rather I would look to add to it with an updated study on whether our profession has succeeded in increasing its intrinsic multiculturalism or 
not.</p>

<p>
My last piece of evidence is another discussion post, this one written for LIBR 220: Reference and Information Services - Legal Resources. In this document, I explain my thoughts on why legal resources should be free, and my thoughts on the subject have not changed. Through coursework and my internship, I learned just how very expensive legal information can be. Proprietary databases like Westlaw and Lexis are prohibitively costly to the average person, and one multi-volume legal treatise can easily cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Just as problematic for a financially-challenged patron seeking legal information is the cost of retaining an attorney. Our legal system does not discourage self-representation, but the costs of being a well-prepared litigant are prohibitively high if not offset by a public law library. If I am fortunate enough to find a position in public law library upon graduation, I feel this knowledge of the economic factors motivating most of my patrons will be helpful in achieving my goal of helping them.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The evidence I have presented here shows that I can recognize the social, cultural and economic factors that impact how patrons use information and library services. Not only can I recognize these factors, though, but I can also extrapolate how they should be used to impact library policy and develop better, stronger services for diverse patrons.
