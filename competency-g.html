<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Professional standards are the backbone of librarianship. Beginning with the accession and catalog books sold by Dewey's library supply company in the late 19th century, librarians have sought for a way to unify the practice of information science. Since Dewey's time, technological advancements have brought necessary changes in the way we catalog, classify and sort data. Today, metadata in the form of library catalog records are created using the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2). A shift to revised rules known as Resource Description and Access (RDA) is in progress, but as of this writing, RDA has yet to be fully implemented. Catalog records are then encoded using Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC 21) bibliographic formats so they can be shared among different institutions. Library science has also standardized subject headings (Library of Congress, Sears, etc.) and classification numbering (Library of Congress, Dewey). All of these standards are based on the basic principle that to create an accurate representation of an object (a surrogate), there must be complete and precise descriptions of the object's attributes. Whether the metadata is managed through complex subject heading thesauri, descriptive cataloging rules or authority control tables matters little; it is the reliance on an agreed-upon system that brings order to disorganized information.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>
The first piece of evidence I have supplied is an example of my ability to apply an underlying principle of information organization: the creation of attributes and values that conform to rules. Created for LIBR 202: Information Retrieval, the assignment asked us to examine a set photographs, create five fields for indexing (called "attributes" in this case), and define those fields for each image (provide "values"). I completed this assignment early in the program, but my understanding of the need to standardize the data was apparent even then. I chose to use only singular nouns as values, and attempted to reduce compound or modified nouns (p. 5). In essence, I had created a cataloging rule that would allow for aggregating data and make searching the catalog easier. My instincts also wanted me to create a controlled vocabulary or authority list of acceptable terms, but our professor had advised against doing so (p. 7). Given the opportunity to revise this paper, it would certainly benefit from what I have learned about how cataloging and indexing rules can and should be applied. </p> 

<p>The next piece of evidence is a subject heading thesaurus that my group* created for LIBR 247: Vocabulary Design. Our group's design was heavily influenced by the pervasive standard for controlled vocabularies, ANSI/NISO Z39.19. This guide is provided by the American National Standards Institute and the National Information Standards Organization and gives conventions for the "contents, display, construction, testing, maintenance, and management of monolingual controlled vocabularies" (NISO, 2011). Using the NISO standards, we chose a to create post-coordinated thesaurus to allow users greater flexibility in searching and thereby reduce the overall number of terms required in the vocabulary. We created a complex system of cross-references, including broader terms, narrower terms, and related terms. Recognizing that users may search on synonyms, we also included a network of entry terms that would point to the acceptable thesaurus terms. Our group worked in sync for the entire project, writing the manual and technical report together and generating the thesaurus hierarchies according to the ANSI/NISO Z39.19 standard. The end result is a thorough and well-executed thesaurus; I would not make any changes to it.</p>

<p>My last piece of evidence shows my mastery of several other information standards, including cataloging rules, encoding formats, subject heading thesauri, and classification schemas. The assignment is actually my final course project for LIBR 248: Beginning Cataloging and Classification. Using an entire semester's worth of knowledge, I was asked to perform original cataloging for eight books. I determined which MARC fields should apply to each book and placed them in the proper order to create a cataloging record. I also completed the MARC fixed fields for each item. After deciding on fields, I added "values" according to AACR2, using this complex standard to make sure that my descriptive cataloging content was uniformly compliant. I then moved on to the subject cataloging for each volume. First I assigned Library of Congress Subject Headings and subheadings, and then I determined the classification number using both Library of Congress Classification and Dewey Decimal Classification. My rationales at the end of the assignment reflect my deep understanding of these information standards. Other than a few debatable decisions concerning the application of rules, I would not change my execution of this course project.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Those who work in databases often say that the information that comes out is only as good as the information that goes in. Standards for cataloging, indexing and other organization methods improve the quality and consistency of the information 
going into databases, catalogs, and thesauri. Users benefit from superior content; their searches are easier and the results more complete and accurate. I have shown through the three assignments described above that I not only understand the basic principles of information standards, but I also know and can apply a wide variety of established standards and conventions.</p>
