<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Performing research is one of my favorite aspects of being a librarian. It is how I spend my day now as an information professional (thought not quite a librarian), and if I am able to move into a law firm reference librarian position upon graduation, it is how I will spend the bulk of my time then as well. Broken down into two categories, research can be either primary or secondary. Examples of primary research depend on the topic. Contemporary research topics often require original studies that use qualitative and/or quantitative measures to draw conclusions. Such topics may also use interviews with living individuals to help answer the research question. Working with live subjects requires a great deal of preparation and adherence to ethical guidelines (such as those certified by the Institutional Review Board). Historical topics use primary sources that were created at the time of the event, such as newspaper articles, diaries, photographs, posters or eyewitness accounts. Secondary research consists of existing research studies and commentary on the topic written by others in the field. Secondary sources should be evaluated based on the authors' credentials and the strength of the information used to support the works' theses. While research can be used in authoring work for publication, it also has an important use as a decision-making tool. For example, libraries and information centers could benefit from someone else's research when deciding which software tool to use. Corporate intelligence research can also be vital for choosing which business opportunities are the most viable and capitalizing on them. </p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p> The first assignment I have listed below is evidence of my understanding of the nature of research and research methods. It is a research proposal I drafted for LIBR 285: Research Methods in Library and Information Science. My proposed thesis explored the effects of aggressive censorship on America's literary record in the late 19th century. As with any serious research proposal, I conducted a thorough review of the existing body of secondary literature concerning the topic. The resulting historiographical essay examines the different approaches that previous historians have taken with respect to censorship and Anthony Comstock and divides these approaches by historical treatment. After clarifying the theoretical approach I planned to use, my proposal moves on to categorize the primary sources I was able to locate. Each source is annotated with a brief description and speculation as to how I might use it to support my thesis. Lastly, I address the more practical issues associated with conducting research - the time and money required to complete the job.</p>

<p>My second piece of evidence, a research paper I wrote for LIBR 280: History of Books and Libraries, establishes my understanding of the nature of research findings and my ability to articulate those findings in a professional manner. The paper explores the history of the Santa Clara City Library from its rudimentary beginnings until 1920. Because few official library records from this time period had survived, I was forced to comb through dozens of microfilm reels in search of newspaper reports on the public library. I sometimes encountered conflicting accounts and had to look for corroboration or rebuttal in other newspapers or oral histories. It seems that rarely did my research findings provide a clear picture of exactly how the library began. Instead, I had to piece together the fragments I could locate to create a coherent story. When speculation was required to bridge a gap in my data, I made certain to classify my statement as such rather than pass on the events as fact. Researching this paper gave me experience with primary and secondary historical resources and taught me how to present my findings as a story that needed to be told.</p>

<p>The third document listed below is a critical summary of a scholarly article that I wrote for LIBR 204: Information Organizations and Management and is evidence of my ability to evaluate and synthesize professional literature to aid in decision-making. The journal article discusses the use of collaborative creativity to create an open-source business model. My evaluation of this article noted that it was slightly biased toward the open-source format and that it also lacked a discussion on the specific steps that should be taken to achieve such a business model. I demonstrate in the summary that I can interpret and fuse the article's ideas with what I know of libraries and their intent to benefit the public.</p> 

<p>My last piece of evidence is a written explanation of one aspect of my job in the record center of a private law firm. Confidentiality restrictions do not permit me to provide sample reports or screen shots; instead, I have provided an essay that summarizes my ability to retrieve, evaluate and synthesize corporate intelligence research and database records to create a useful report that attorneys rely on to make informed and ethical decisions with regard to accepting new business. This summary establishes my ability to conduct research for a specific client group with the goal of assisting in the decision-making process.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have conducted research using both primary and secondary sources, analyzed my research findings, and compiled them into a coherent format. I have retrieved scholarly and professional research, evaluated it critically and synthesized it with other resources for the maximum benefit of a specific client group looking to make an informed decision. I have mastered Competency L.</p>
