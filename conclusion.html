<h2>Reflections</h2>


<p>My experience in the MLIS program has been a rewarding one. The course load was challenging, especially given the online format and combined with a full-time job. I was forced to draw on my somewhat rusty time-management skills. I have always considered myself an organized person, and that attribute certainly served me well throughout my time in the program. Asynchronous, remote learning also requires self-motivation, dedication, and expert communication. Although I may not have started the program in possession of these traits, I did develop them over time, and they were strong contributors to my ultimate success.</p> 

<p>I plan to ease myself back into a more leisurely, school-free schedule following graduation. I am looking forward to taking a more active role in the local law library associations of which I am already a member. Networking will be my primary focus for the next few months. I also hope to take on some librarian-esque tasks at the firm where I currently work to foster my professional growth. Although my employer does not have a full-time library position available at this time, I feel that there is scope for me to earn valuable experience before I make the jump to the role of librarian. Once I feel confident in my reference and collection management abilities, I will begin the job-search process. I am fortunate enough to already be gainfully employed; I will not be under any undue pressure to find a job right away. When the time comes, I hope to find a position that will be a good fit all around, one where I can put to good use the knowledge and skills I have gained in this program.</p>

<h2>Closing Remarks</h2>



<p>This portfolio marks the conclusion of more than three years of hard work. It is a true scholarly achievement. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to learn from some of the brightest minds in the field of library and information science, and I look forward to actively supporting the MLIS program as an alumna. Thank you for taking the time to read and review my e-Portfolio.</p>
