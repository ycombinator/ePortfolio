<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Welcome to the e-Portfolio I have created in fulfillment of my Master of Library and Information Science degree from San Jose State University. I began this program in Fall 2008 with the intention of completing a thesis. As circumstances in my life and work changed, I revised my plans to include the e-Portfolio instead. The MLIS program has given me practical skills and theoretical knowledge, but more importantly, it has taught me a great deal about what it means to be a librarian. I enjoyed this retrospective look at all that I have achieved as I worked to become a legitimate part of the library community.</p> 

<p>The e-Portfolio consists of fourteen competencies. Mastery of each competency is required for matriculation and is proved through pieces of evidence taken from coursework or job experience. I began my e-Portfolio in early 2011, about five months before I planned to enroll in the course. My first step was to set up folders for each competency on my computer. I then reviewed the green sheets from each course I took and plotted out the assignments (and topics, if relevant) onto index cards. I compared those index cards to the list of competencies and began creating duplicate files of assignments in any competency folder that seemed pertinent. Next, I created a spreadsheet where I listed each piece of potential evidence on the tab for each competency. I then began to jot down ideas for what each competency meant to me and how I would use the evidence to support my mastery. I completed the spreadsheet two weeks before my e-Portfolio semester was due to begin.</p>

<p>In the remaining two weeks, I began work on my presentation method. I chose to use a personal website to display my e-Portfolio so I could have greater control over the design and future use of the content. I chose my design and enlisted the help of my husband to create the backend structure for my site. The basic architecture of the site was ready for the first day of my e-Portfolio class.</p> 

<p>The competency statements I have written are viewable from the navigation bar on the left side of the screen. Each statement consists of an introduction that explains my understanding of the competency and its importance to librarianship, a discussion of my evidence, and a brief conclusion. Where necessary, I have included references cited using APA format. The evidence supporting each competency is hyperlinked at the bottom of the competency page. </p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to review my e-Portfolio. I hope my success in the MLIS program is apparent through the work I have compiled here.</p>
