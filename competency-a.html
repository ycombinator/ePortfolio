<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Libraries have not always been the bastions of intellectual freedom that they are today. A look back in history shows that for a long period of time written information was accessible only to those with power. Simply put, power manifested initially as the ability to read; later, as literacy spread, power derived from monetary wealth. Books were costly and very dear. Those that could afford to accumulate volumes in a collection protected their investment by chaining the books to shelves. In the United States, the first non-private libraries were subscription-based and became centers of knowledge for the elite, upper-classes. Thankfully, by the middle of the 19th century, free, public libraries had begun to appear throughout the U.S., and the notion of free access to information had also spread. A small cast of diligent librarians, including Melvil Dewey, appeared on scene and managed to transform the library vocation into a respected profession. Banding together with a united professional purpose, librarians took up the cause of intellectual freedom and formalized their protective intent through ethical codes and a bill of rights. It is important for us to remember this long path to protected access to information as we consider the promotion of intellectual freedom within the field of librarianship.</p>

<p>Library and information science is not a stale or stagnant field, and in fact, those who study and practice it thrive on its constant changes. We seek out debates fostered by the rapid introduction of new concepts and ideas; it is through these debates that our professional ethics, values and principles are solidified. One piece of common ground has emerged through this discourse: modern librarians share a desire to help others understand the world around them. Understanding comes from knowledge, and knowledge, from information. Today's librarians take their role in this process very seriously; we are the providers and protectors of free access to information.</p>

<p>The American Library Association (ALA) adopted the first <em>Library Bill of Rights</em> in 1948 in order to lay down protections for intellectual freedom. These rights provide an excellent summary of the foundational principles and ethics of the library profession. Three of these beliefs are examined below. First, I will discuss the notion that modern librarianship is founded on the principle that library users should be given access to all information that is relevant and necessary to them. Second, I will explain how modern librarians are ethically bound to actively resist the censorship of information. Lastly, I will articulate the value that libraries place on the protection of privacy for their constituents.</p>

<p>Providing free access to information is a well-known goal of public libraries. Supported through local city and county taxes, public libraries offer residents free borrowing privileges, free-but-limited Internet access and no-cost special events, programs and classes. The process of determining <em>what</em> information will be available for borrowing and <em>which</em> programs will be offered is at the heart of the first foundational principle. The <em>Bill of Rights</em> states that libraries should make certain to provide information on "all points of view on current and historical issues," regardless of its origin (Rubin, 2004, p. 203). Collection development and programming decisions must be made with utmost care to ensure that equitable access is granted to library users. Librarians have a responsibility to put aside their own personal biases, focusing on the needs of their patrons as they build a balanced and well-rounded collection.</p>

<p>Censorship can take many forms. In the days of Anthony Comstock and the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, censorship was a volatile and sometimes violent attack against artists and authors. (These attacks may have resulted in self-censorship on the part of some authors. I explore this concept further in my research proposal for LIBR 285, which will be used as evidence for other competencies.) With the introduction of the Internet age, dispersal of information has become harder to control and new censorship methods have evolved. Librarians are ethically bound to oppose acts of censorship, both in their own actions and libraries and in the broader information-sharing community. Our duty as protectors of intellectual freedom is to make sure that we uphold our professional principles and acknowledge the laws set forth by Ranganathan, namely "every person his or her book" and "every book, its reader" (Eberhart, 2006, p. 65). We must recognize that patrons have a right to information, even if it is unorthodox or unpopular; we must not judge the suitability of their needs.</p>

<p>With regard to censorship, it is not enough to only police our own behavior. Librarians must be active in publicizing attempted censorship and holding censors accountable for their actions. Banned Books Week, an event organized by the ALA, is an excellent example of how librarians can bring historical perspective to a modern debate. By directing attention to past acts of censorship, Banned Books Week broadcasts the perils of restraining the accessibility of information in a free society. Censorship is not limited to printed materials in today's electronic age; Internet filters have become quite the hot-button issue in libraries. The debate between protecting younger patrons and providing unrestricted access for all patrons rages on. If the debate reaches a consensus, its resolution will add to the fabric of our profession's ethics and foundational principles.</p>

<p>Librarians value privacy protection. In fact, many librarians are fierce advocates of patron privacy, even in the face of stalwart opposition. The library profession considers it paramount that patrons be granted the right to open inquiries without fear of examination. Information gathering should be facilitated, not monitored. Under the Patriot Act and other library screening programs, borrowing and browsing histories became popular targets of U.S. government and law enforcement agencies looking to fuel investigative fires. The legal precedent set by these programs has brought vocal librarians to the table as they debate their professional duty to protect patrons' privacy while remaining within the confines of the law.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>
<p>My first piece of evidence is a critical notes summary that I produced for LIBR 200: Information and Society. The assignment allowed us to choose any topic covered in the course; I chose to interpret an article on the importance of assigning significance in collection development decisions. I learned that the simple act of choosing what to include in a collection designates the selected items as important and diminishes the significance of items not chosen. In cultures where equality is not favored, making these sorts of decisions and assigning significance amount to the exertion of power over others. I understood from the article that, even in places where libraries strive to be equitable, we must still be aware of our propensity to introduce bias in our decisions and the likelihood that these biases may result in only the dominant narratives being chosen and preserved. When space and finances become an issue in my future role as a law librarian and weeding becomes necessary, I will also need to make sure that I am considering which viewpoints are being acknowledged and which are being marginalized based on my choices. If I had written this paper today, I would have sought out a librarian or two and asked them for details on how they put this particular principle into practice on a daily basis.</p>

<p>My second piece of evidence is a series of discussion posts I made in response to a prompt on the ethics of librarianship for LIBR 210: Reference and Information Services. Each of these posts, one original and two in response to my classmates' posts (my work is in green font), discusses a different scenario in which a librarian's ethical conduct is tested. My original post shows that I understand and acknowledge the gray areas involved in censoring potentially harmful information from patrons based on appearance. I was (and still am) of the belief that librarians should not judge the patron or her motives. If there is a potential for serious negative consequences, those scenarios can and should be handled within the guidelines set forth by the institution, but access to information and intellectual freedom should not be denied. A person's attire, even if unkempt or atypical, should not factor into my response to his query, no matter the topic. Librarians must not censor the assistance they provide. As I move into a formal librarian role, I must leave my personal beliefs and biases at the door when I enter the workplace. </p>

<p>The third piece of evidence in support of this competency is a research paper I wrote for LIBR 244: Online Searching. The title of the paper is "Internet Censorship Around the Globe: How Countries Try to Block Search Engine Results and What Users Are Doing to Circumvent Them." In this essay, I explore the efforts of three nations &mdash; China, Iran and Pakistan &mdash; to filter search results on common Internet search engines Google, Yahoo! and Microsoft Bing. Through my research, I learned that no matter the pressures these large Internet companies face, they are unlikely to make strong protests against censorship because they stand to boost their profit margins by remaining passive. It is up to intellectual freedom advocates &mdash; among them, librarians &mdash; to draw attention to these autocratic governments and the abhorrent methods they use to quiet dissident voices. The assignment also allowed me to explore the many practical tricks and tools that Internet users have developed to let their voices be heard and to gain access to information that would otherwise be forbidden. Given the opportunity to rework this assignment, I would have delved more into the motivations for censoring electronic search results; a greater understanding of the reasons for the censorship would help me combat it in word and deed.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have included a research paper I wrote for LIBR 221: Government Information Systems which explores the efforts by U.S. government agencies to protect the privacy of the citizens whose information they gather. Written near the end of my tenure in the program and given the assignment parameters, there is nothing I would change about this paper, except perhaps to examine the issue of privacy in public libraries a bit more. While researching and writing this paper, I learned of the many privacy breaches and near-misses that have occurred in the recent past in the government documents landscape. I saw how agencies have attempted to correct these errors by issuing stricter policy doctrines that emphasize their commitment to privacy protection. Most strikingly, though, I realized that policy statements are ineffective if the front-line labor force does not espouse the spirit of the policy. Library administrators should certainly draft privacy policies, but they must also educate and inspire their employees to want to protect the privacy of library patrons.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although history proves this was not always the case, the library profession as it stands today is united in its belief that access to information should be free and universal. We value privacy and egalitarianism in our libraries, and we strive to eliminate all forms of censorship. As seen through my four pieces of evidence, I have researched and analyzed these principles, articulated their importance, and extrapolated how they should influence my professional behavior as a future librarian, a defender of intellectual freedom, and a participant in the numerous debates surrounding these issues.</p>
