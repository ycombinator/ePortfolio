<h2>My professional goals</h2>



<p>I began the MLIS program intending to become a special collections librarian. As changes in my personal life began to lead me away from academic librarianship, though, I found myself considering a different career path. I have worked in law firms for six years and at one time, thought I might like to go to law school. Law school was eliminated from my career plans primarily because I could not imagine spending so many hours per week working; my family requires that I have a better work-life balance. While I may not have been able to tolerate the lifestyle of a lawyer, the logical, methodical practice of law and the need for problem-solving skills have always appealed to me. I began speaking with the librarian on staff at the firm where I am currently employed about what it is like to be a law librarian. My conversations with her led me to seek internship experience and to change my intended courses and career plan. It is now my desire to become a law librarian, hopefully in a private firm.</p>

<p>If I had my pick of employment positions, my first choice would be as a solo librarian for a small- to medium-size private law firm. Drawing from internship experience, I know that in order to achieve this goal, I must be at ease with legal resources and have strong collection management skills. Competencies B and F serve as proof of the time I have spent mastering the ability to manage, develop and evaluate a law library collection. Secondly, I really enjoy the reference aspect of librarianship and would like to spend a large part of my professional life in this capacity. As demonstrated in Competencies E, I and L, I learned how to query information retrieval systems, conduct reference interviews, and perform high-level research using primary and secondary sources. These skills will surely form the foundation of the reference services I hope to offer. Next, if I am lucky enough to work "in-house" for a law firm, I will be asked to conduct training sessions for new attorneys as they are hired. The theoretical knowledge I have showcased in Competencies J and K will be put to good use as I design my own training programs. Lastly, as a law librarian, I will be expected to uphold certain professional and ethical codes of conduct, especially protection of privacy and confidentiality, respect for disparate financial budgets, and defense of intellectual freedom. My familiarity with these professional ideals is established in Competencies A and C.</p>

<p>Completing this degree will be my first step in achieving my professional goal of becoming a reference librarian in a law firm. The next step will be to locate a position that helps me gain relevant experience and that allows me to network with fellow librarians. To strengthen my foothold in the law library community, I also plan to transition from student to professional member in the American Association of Law Libraries, the Northern California Association of Law Libraries, and the Silicon Valley Law Librarians Association. I feel well-prepared to take the next steps to becoming a law librarian.</p>

<h2>My conception of law librarianship</h2>


<p>Based on my professional goal to work in a private law firm, I see law librarianship as a service profession helping a service profession. Lawyers are bound by a professional oath to uphold the law while serving clients in an ethical manner. In California, attorneys must swear to "support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California, and ... faithfully discharge the duties of an attorney and counselor at law to the best of [his or her] knowledge and ability" (State Bar, n.d.). I see it as the duty of a law librarian to make certain that the attorney is as knowledgeable and able as possible by providing complete and accurate research, access to valid and timely legal materials, and training in legal research skills.</p>

<p>Just as there are dozens of legal practice types, so too can law librarians have different areas of specialization. From federal immigration law to state criminal law, from tax law to patent law, law librarians tend to develop expert understanding of the legal field they work in most frequently. Yet even with a primary focus to their work, most law librarians find they need a broader familiarity with legal materials for those atypical, unusual requests. My internship in a corporate law firm library demonstrated clearly that law librarians need to be ready for anything, especially when an attorney has struck out with his own research. As Elias (2009) cheekily reminds us, "[law] libraries come with another helpful resource you'll have trouble replicating on the Internet - librarians" (p. 21). Knowing what questions to ask and where to look for the answers forms the base of any law librarian's skill-set, regardless of area specialization and allows them to better serve their patrons.</p>

<p>The bulk of a law librarian's day is taken up with two primary functions: reference and collection management. Both of these tasks are heavily influenced by how attorneys use information. Legal research is conducted differently than scholarly research in other fields, and even within the legal field, students conduct research differently than practicing attorneys who also have different search practices than law librarians. Emphasizing the need for law librarians to understand the habits and preferences of their patrons, Davidson (2010) claims that "understanding how and when [attorneys] use various library resources for the type of scholarship they do would better assist librarians ... with collection development and service model development" (p. 563). Law librarians who work with attorneys must be aware of these differences and take them into account when building a collection or answering reference questions.</p> 

<p>My coursework, my internship experience and the time I have spent networking with colleagues in the field have given me a strong understanding of what it means to be a law firm librarian. I am aware of the professional challenges, especially for the role of solo librarian, and feel I am well-prepared to meet these challenges when I obtain my first formal librarian position.</p>

<h2>My contribution to the well-being of our communities</h2>

<p>I have said it before, but it bears repeating: librarianship is a service profession. At its root, it seeks to aide the betterment of individuals and communities by providing access to information and knowledge. I have shown throughout this portfolio that I have reflected on the contributions our profession can make to the cultural, economic, educational and social well-being of our society. In Competency A, I explain how librarians protect the right to free access to information. My work for Competency C shows my appreciation for the positive impact that public libraries can have on economically-disadvantaged or minority groups. Through my supporting evidence for Competencies J and K, I have demonstrated my ability to offer education and training to library patrons.</p>

<p>As a law firm librarian, I will have a unique opportunity to give back to my community by assisting attorneys in their pro bono work. Pro bono matters are taken on free of charge and usually assist individuals with urgent personal claims, such as asylum status applications, restraining or protective orders, and immigration filings. Pro bono work is an integral part of the legal profession. Its sole aim is to help someone in need of legal guidance who would not be able to afford representation otherwise. As a law firm librarian, I will be able to contribute to this important work through the research assistance I provide. My efforts will help to improve the lives of our most important patrons - those who cannot help themselves.</p>
