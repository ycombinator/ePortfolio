<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>
One of the great advantages of the San Jose State SLIS program is that we are encouraged to learn about many different library environments. I began my degree with the intent to enter academic librarianship. As I progressed through the program, I quickly realized that I have a greater affinity for special libraries. My fortuitous exposure through coursework to different aspects of academic, public and special libraries was one of the primary motivators for shifting my career path.</p>



<p>Each library environment is ruled by a unique combination of factors. A library's patron base, the parent institution, and the type and amount of available funding all
 contribute to its atmosphere and operations. Funding issues are at the top of most library agendas today; I have chosen to examine how different types of librarians adjust to working within budgetary limits. Public libraries struggle to obtain adequate funding which results in restrictions placed on the services they can offer. Academic libraries, although much better funded than public libraries, have also found themselves being marginalized in university budgets; like public librarians, some academic librarians have sought creative solutions that exist outside the formal budget. Lastly, special libraries, especially corporate ones, are exceedingly well-funded, and special librarians rarely experience a shortage of resources while performing their jobs.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>
The first piece of evidence listed below involves work in a public library. It is a research assignment I completed for LIBR 220: Reference and Information Services - Legal Resources. I was required to visit a law library in person; I chose the Santa Clara County Law Library, a free, public law library. The bulk of this assignment involved familiarizing myself with the library layout and interacting with common legal resources. During my exploration of the facility, though, I was confronted with the troubling evidence of insufficient funding (see p. 3 of evidence). The library had posted signs throughout its state law section claiming that all subscriptions to state legal codes had been canceled, with the exception of California, Arizona, Nevada and Oregon. My conversation with the librarian revealed that this dramatic reduction in the print collection was primarily due to financial limitations. The funding was not available to maintain the print subscriptions or support the staff hours required to update the volumes, so the administration made the difficult choice to discontinue the less-frequently used sets. This assignment forced me to recognize and understand the financial burdens placed on the library, the reasons for making this particular weeding decision, and the frustrations that will inevitably result when patrons require a state code that is no longer current. If I had the opportunity to speak with the law librarian on the same topic again, I would ask more questions about the feedback the library had received from its patrons regarding this collection policy change, and I would also want to know if the library had been able to assist patrons looking for codes outside of the four aforementioned states.
</p>

<p>The next assignment I am submitting for evidence portrays what I have learned of how some academic librarians, special collections curators to be specific, find work-arounds for a small (or non-existent) technological budget. I conducted this interview as part of a site study for LIBR 247: Vocabulary Design. I was lucky to make contact with the Head of Research and Information Systems at the Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology at UC Berkeley. While the primary content of the interview is not directly relevant to this competency, the fact that this individual was designing his own controlled vocabulary is precisely on point. He found that existing controlled vocabularies were either too limited, too confusing, or most importantly, much too expensive. He contemplated open-source solutions, but found them lacking. His creative workaround was to develop a home-grown vocabulary all on his own, a project that required hundreds of man-hours outside of his main job responsibilities. I learned from his example that there is no replacement for hard work when money becomes an issue. I hope to be as dedicated to my future position as my interviewee is to his. I think it is also worth mentioning that most public librarians would be able to commiserate with this information professional on the necessity of creative and over-and-above efforts to meet library needs on a tight budget.</p>

<p>My last piece of evidence is my first log from LIBR 294: Professional Experience - Internships. Throughout my semester-long tenure at a law firm library, I witnessed many examples of the wealth of funding available in such an environment. When a case went to trial, Joanne Scala*, the firm librarian, ordered a second set of trial manuals for the attorneys to take with them on the road, a $500 purchase, so that the firm's in-house copy would not be damaged (p. 4). 
Rather than have Scala take up her time filing loose-leaf updates to reporters and treatises, the firm outsourced the job to a specialized vendor (p. 3). As is also evident throughout the report, Scala had her choice of print and electronic resources and nearly unlimited funding. It was great fun to play with so many fancy research tools, but I quickly learned that expensive does not always mean best. Often, a free website can provide the answer you seek just as well as a proprietary database, and just because special libraries are not forced to find creative solutions to problems, as public and academic libraries are, does not mean they should always choose the more costly option.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have explored the different worlds of public, academic and special libraries through conversations with experts and the coursework listed below. I am familiar with the varied environments of these worlds, but also with their shared characteristics. My explanation of evidence shows my understanding of one set of criteria: library operations within a given budget. I have mastered Competency B, and I feel that my greater appreciation for different organizational settings will serve me well as a member of the library community.</p>
