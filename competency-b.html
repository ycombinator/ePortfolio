<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>
One of the great advantages of the San Jose State SLIS program is that we are encouraged to learn about many different library environments. I began my degree with the intent to enter academic librarianship. As I progressed through the program, I quickly realized that I have a greater affinity for special libraries. My fortuitous exposure through coursework to different aspects of academic, public, special, archival and digital libraries was one of the primary motivators for shifting my career path.</p>



<p>Each library environment is ruled by a unique combination of factors. A library's services, values, patron base, parent institution, and the type and amount of available funding all
 contribute to its atmosphere and operations. Public libraries typically offer a wide variety of programming and events to supplement their more traditional material offerings. Digital libraries do not offer in-person services, but they do provide a greater level of convenience to the patron and can make finding information faster and easier. Public and academic libraries often struggle to obtain adequate funding while special libraries, especially corporate ones, are exceedingly well-funded. Organizational decisions are handled in much the same way in all types of brick-and-mortar libraries, typically with the input of a committee. All libraries and archives value privacy protection, although some make stronger efforts to protect patron rights than others.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>The first document that I am supplying as evidence of my ability to compare library environments is a discussion post I wrote for LIBR 220: Resources and Information Services - Legal Resources. The prompt asked us to compare and contrast the different methods for performing legal research from the patron's perspective. I listed the advantages and disadvantages of a brick-and-mortar public law library, free digital resources and subscription-based digital libraries and databases. The major difference between digital and traditional libraries is that electronic resources lack the face-to-face assistance one would receive in a brick-and-mortar library. Digital libraries do offer electronic reference and hotline numbers to call, but for tricky questions (especially those dealing with legal materials), it is often more helpful to seek guidance in person. A second difference is that materials in a public library can be unavailable, checked out or in use, but this does not typically occur in digital libraries, particularly those for which access is paid. Both types of libraries can be free, but some digital libraries do require a subscription fee or per-use payment. Finally, if the collection developers have done their jobs well, both types of libraries can be depended upon to have reliable resources and materials.</p>

<p>In my second piece of evidence, a research paper for LIBR 221: Government Information Sources, I compare how different types of government archives, record centers and libraries are attempting to protect the personally identifiable information in their possession. First, I inspected the record-keeping of federal agencies and found that most of these archives are poorly protected and exceptionally vulnerable. I speculate in my paper that these failures might be due to disorganized archives and other troubles associated with navigating a large bureaucratic system. In contrast, state-run record centers attached to court offices have had much better success at protecting private information. They benefit from a smaller sphere of influence and have more control over their documentation, how it is used and how it is accessed. Lastly, I examine the public library, operated at the local government level. Public libraries are among the strongest proponents of privacy, and it is the work of individuals that makes the difference. Where large agency archives and moderately-sized record centers fail to make privacy a priority, public librarians succeed. In fact, they are only hindered by state and federal legislation that compels them to violate a patron's privacy for legal reasons.</p>

<p>The last two assignments attached below give evidence of my ability to compare academic and special libraries. The first is a case study performed for LIBR 204: Information Organizations and Management. In this paper, I examine the planning attempts, decision-making processes and implementation efforts of an academic special collections library and a law firm record center as they roll out a new piece of software. I found that both facilities relied on committees in the planning stages, especially when it came to determining project requirements and making recommendations for software functionality. Financial decisions and budgets did not play a large part in the process for the special library; there was a maximum dollar amount in mind, which appeared to be generous enough to reasonably accommodate the project's needs. In contrast, the academic librarian
 was required to make a software choice based largely on the <em>lack</em> of a budget. She opted for an open-source product which would allow her to devote her meager project funds to the salary of an additional staff member to clean up the data. The last notable difference between the two environments was the use of periodic goals to march the project forward. The record center did not use them, whereas the academic library did. The last piece of evidence is the fourth log I wrote for my internship, LIBR 294*. On page 3 of this report, I briefly explain my observations of the differences between an academic law library and a private law firm library. Some of these impressions include the formal use of classification numbers, the enormous print collection and the dedicated work space of the academic library. To compare, my internship site's physical collection was relatively small, without a formal classification system or a traditional library reading room.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have explored the different worlds of academic, public, special, archival and digital libraries through conversations with experts and the coursework listed below. I am familiar with the many differences of these environments, but also with their shared characteristics. I have mastered Competency B, and I feel that my greater appreciation for different organizational settings will serve me well as a member of the library community.</p>
