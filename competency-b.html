<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>
One of the great advantages of the San Jose State SLIS program is that we are encouraged to learn about many different library environments. I began my degree with the intent to enter academic librarianship. As I progressed through the program, I quickly realized that I have a greater affinity for special libraries. My fortuitous exposure through coursework to different aspects of academic, public and special libraries was one of the primary motivators for shifting my career path.</p>



<p>Each library environment is ruled by a unique combination of factors. A library's patron base, the parent institution, and the type and amount of available funding all
 contribute to its atmosphere and operations. Funding issues are at the top of most library agendas today; it is interesting to examine the relative sizes and sources of library budgets and how different types of librarians adjust to working within those budgetary limits. The following analysis of library resources is drawn in broad strokes; as with anything in life, there are always exceptions to the rule.</p>

<p>
Public libraries are tax-supported. Their funding is dependent upon the local population and can sometimes be tied into property taxes. In times of economic downturn, public library funding is altogether too often viewed as expendable, resulting in cuts to library budgets. Since I started the SLIS program, this phenomenon has become a sort of epidemic. Public libraries have been forced to reduce staff size and cut operating hours. Library branches that were once open six days a week are now only offering limited hours on three or four days a week. Public library administrators and librarians have been forced to cut corners in their collection development efforts as well. Many have looked for creative ways to overcome the funding dilemma, by seeking private donations from the community and relying on volunteers to help with staffing shortages.
 Public libraries will always be fighting to prove their worth in a community, and in the current economic climate where financial support is threatened, winning this fight is especially imperative for survival.</p> 

<p>In relative terms, the budget of the average academic library far exceeds that of most public libraries, especially if the library is
 
tied to a private university. Many universities have endowments, often funded by wealthy alumni or other interested parties and valued into the millions of dollars. Building remodels, special events and colloquia, and collection development and acquisitions may all fall under the purview of an endowment fund. The presence of an endowment does not necessarily mean the library is fully or even well funded, though. Many academic libraries still find themselves part of the university budget, sometimes fighting for every dollar just as public libraries do. If we are to be fair to the predicament of public libraries, though, we must admit that the budgetary dilemmas of an academic librarian are not typically as dire as those of public librarians, and most academic institutions have adequate funds to keep the library operatingly soundly. A withdrawal or severe cut in financial support by the host institution would negatively impact the quality of service and reputation of the university. Academic libraries are integral to the success of a university, and therefore, academic librarians have little fear of funding shortages.</p>

<p>Technology is one area that still proves financially difficult for academic libraries. This is especially true for a particular subset of academic libraries: special collections. Whether the collection is housed in a museum affiliated with a university or in the university library itself, these small but important departments have unique needs. They require assistance beyond what the typical cataloging tools can provide in documenting, classifying and storing their artifacts. Academic budgets rarely account for this service gap, and special collection librarians and curators must often look for creative work-arounds, such as opensource software or a homegrown tool.</p>

<p>
Lastly, we look to the budgeting concerns of the special library. Special libraries can cover a wide variety of subject matter and vary in size. Most are housed in a corporate environment, and it is these libraries, especially law firm libraries, with which I am most familiar. A corporate library in contrast to public libraries, rarely, if ever, has budgeting concerns. If the company suffers, of course, so will the library. But if the company is thriving and the existence of a library is warranted, it is uncommon to find an insufficiently funded corporate library. In fact, in a law firm, research expenses are often passed on to the client as part of the billable hours, so while the librarian must remain conscious of escalating costs, there is usually no great cause for concern over every dime spent. Acquiring a new technology is rarely an issue if a case can be made for its necessity; some firms even task their Information Technology departments to create tools as and when librarians need them. Physical space is often a greater burden to the special librarian than the financial bottom line. The real threat to special libraries is the possibility that the need for such a department is no longer recognized. Because it is not necessarily essential to the operation of the company, a special library must always be certain to demonstrate its value to its parent institution.
</p>

<p>
Public libraries are notoriously poorly funded, and their staff members are often forced to find unorthodox solutions to operating problems. In contrast, academic libraries and special libraries have less money woes, on the whole, and day to day operations are not threatened by a bleak financial outlook. With survival assured, academic libraries find themselves battling more trivial budgetary issues, such as minimal support for specialized technological tools. Special libraries are exempt from even this concern. Rarely needing to be concerned with money, the special librarian is free to conquer other obstacles, such as balancing the demands of a solo librarian position or weeding a growing collection contained within finite space. Although adequate funding may not be a concern, special libraries do share one ordeal with their poorer counterparts in the public sector: both libraries must be persistent in demonstrating their value and worth to their funding sources.
</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>[ADD STATEMENTS ABOUT WHETHER I'D CHANGE EVIDENCE OR NOT]</p>

<p>
The first two pieces of evidence listed below involve work in and research on public libraries. The first is a research assignment I completed for LIBR 220: Reference and Information Services - Legal Resources. I was required to visit a law library in person; I chose the Santa Clara County Law Library, a free, public law library funded by court filing fees. The bulk of this assignment involved familiarizing myself with the library layout and interacting with common legal resources. During my exploration of the facility, though, I was confronted with the troubling evidence of insufficient funding (see p. 3 of evidence). The library had posted signs throughout its state law section claiming that all subscriptions to state legal codes had been canceled, with the exception of California, Arizona, Nevada and Oregon. My conversation with the librarian on duty revealed that this dramatic reduction in the print collection was primarily due to financial limitations. The funding was not available to maintain the print subscriptions any longer, so the administration made the difficult choice to discontinue the less-frequently used sets. As a library science student, I was able to understand the financial burdens placed on the library, the reasons for making this particular weeding decision, and the frustrations that will inevitably result when patrons require a state code that is no longer current.
</p>

<p>As stated, the second piece of evidence also pertains to public libraries, this time showcasing a creative workaround that some public libraries have employed to bolster their collections. This discussion post was written for LIBR 221: Government Information Sources on the topic of bringing the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) into the digital age.
 Through course readings, I learned that the FDLP offers a great service to its member libraries. For no cost, these libraries are able to add information-rich resources to their collections. In fact, if FDLP libraries had to pay for the volumes or subscriptions the receive through the program, it is likely that most could not afford the breadth of material they currently hold. In one anecdote I read, a public librarian chose to designate her library as a depository library solely for access to the <em>U.S. Government Manual</em> and the Congressional Information Service, two very expensive but highly useful publications. This is the type of creative thinking that will be expected of me, should I take a position in a financially-challenged public library.</p>

<p>My third piece of evidence is a historical background that I wrote as part of a group project for LIBR 204: Information Organizations and Management. The project required my team to develop a strategic plan for a library of our choosing. Sharing a common interest in academic libraries, my group chose the University of Texas at Austin as its focus. One of the sections I completed was the historical background of the UT libraries (found on pages 3 through 7 in the attached document). I interviewed Dennis Dillon, an assistant director, to gain insight into the administrative operations of the massive library system. Through my conversations with
 Dillon, I learned about the delicate relationship between an academic library and its university parent. UT Austin is heavily dependent on its library to help it maintain its position as a top-ranked research institution and is in no danger of falling by the wayside. What I took away most from this portion of the project was the level of comfort that the librarian felt with his position and that of his facility. Sure, there are always obstacles to overcome, but as an academic librarian at a large university, those obstacles are rarely so large as those faced in less well-funded public libraries.</p>

<p>The next two assignments I am submitting for evidence portray small examples of how some academic librarians, special collections curators to be specific, find work arounds for working with a small technological budget. In the first assignment for LIBR 204: Information Organizations and Management, I was asked to write an evaluation of organizational change from two perspectives. I chose a technological change and interviewed information professionals in a corporate setting and academic special collections setting. I learned from my interview with Glynn Edwards (pages 7 to 9 of essay) that the Stanford University special collections library needed an inexpensive but effective solution to its collection database woes. Edwards' choice was an open-source collection management tool, Archivists' Toolkit, and was able to remain well within her limited budget while increasing the productivity of her department. I plan to emulate her willingness to look outside the box for a software solution when I am faced with tough budget restrictions. The next assignment is a site study I performed for LIBR 247: Vocabulary Design. After conducting an interview with a vocabulary designer, we were asked to create PowerPoint slides and present to our class via Elluminate. I was lucky to make contact with Michael Black at the Phoebe Hearst Museum of Anthropology at UC Berkeley. While the content of the presentation is not directly relevant to this competency, the fact that Black was designing his own controlled vocabulary is precisely on point. Black found that existing controlled vocabularies were either too limited, too confusing, or as expected, much too expensive. His creative workaround was to develop a home-grown vocabulary all on his own. His success is evident through the screenshots I deliver as part of my presentation. I can safely state that there is no replacement for hard work when money becomes an issue. I hope to be as dedicated to my future position as Michael Black is to his. I think it is also worth mentioning that most public librarians would be able to commiserate with Edwards and Black on the necessity of creative and over-and-above efforts to meet library needs.</p>

<p>My last piece of evidence is the final report from LIBR 294: Professional Experience - Internships. Throughout my semester-long tenure at a law firm library, I saw many examples of the wealth of funding available in such an environment. When a case went to trial, Joanne Scala, the firm librarian, ordered a second set of trial manuals for the attorneys to take with them on road, a $700 purchase, so that the firm's in-house copy would not be damaged (p. 6). 
Rather than have Scala take up her time filing loose-leaf updates to reporters and treatises, the firm outsourced the job to a specialized vendor (p. 5). As is also evident throughout the report, Scala had her choice of resources and nearly unlimited funding. It was great fun to play with so many fancy research tools, but I quickly learned that expensive does not always mean best. Often, a free website can provide the answer you seek just as well as a proprietary database, and just because special libraries are not forced to find creative solutions to problems, as public libraries are, does not mean they should always choose the easy option.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have explored the different worlds of public, academic and special libraries through the coursework listed below. I am familiar with their varied environments, but also with their shared characteristics. The preceding statement explains my understanding of one set of criteria: funding levels, funding sources, and operations within a given budget. I have mastered Competency B, and I feel that my greater appreciation for different organizational settings will serve me well as a member of the library community.</p>
