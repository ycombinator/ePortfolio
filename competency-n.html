<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>The only way to measure success or failure is to compare an actual outcome with a desired outcome. We call this comparison "evaluation," and it is a necessary and important part of any librarian's job. To know if a solution solved the problem, we evaluate the performance of that solution against a set of specific criteria. To know if a library service is meeting the needs of patrons, we evaluate that service through surveys, interviews and usage statistics. To know if a training program achieved its goals, we conduct formative evaluations with the learners. When applied using quantitative or qualitative criteria, evaluations hold the library program or service accountable to the users. As most administrations rely on evaluations when making budget allotments, librarians need to examine the programs and services under their purview and use evaluations to make the case for continued support. </p> 

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>I submit as my first piece of evidence a series of discussion posts I wrote for LIBR 210: Reference and Information Services. In this commentary, I explain how I would evaluate the reference services of a library if I was part of the administration. I chose to analyze and evaluate the questions that get asked and which resources are most frequently used to answer those queries. My evaluation would also include an examination of which questions could <em>not</em> be answered because there was no available resource. The point of the evaluation is to determine which collection items can be eliminated to create space and funding for other, more frequently-needed resources. Later, in my response posts, I demonstrate that I know how librarians can use evaluations to improve their level of service, whether by becoming more knowledgeable about topics for which they failed to provide adequate answers or by thinking creatively to locate an answer for a patron. These discussion posts are evidence that I have thought about how best to evaluate a library service (i.e. reference) and how librarians can respond to boost poor evaluation results.</p>

<p>My second piece of evidence also pertains to reference services, though this time I actually performed the evaluation of five real-life reference encounters from the perspective of the patron. Written for LIBR 210: Reference and Information Services, my reflective essay uses the Reference and User Services Association's <em>Guidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and Information Service Providers</em> and other scholarly literature to formulate three primary criteria for evaluating my reference experiences. The first and most important criteria was effective communication and was judged by how well the librarian listened, how attentive to details she was, whether or not she allowed me to complete my thoughts and if she prompted me for details using open-ended questions. The other two criteria used to evaluate the interviews were the time taken to answer the question and the accuracy of the answer I received. Of my five encounters, only one measured favorably on all of these criteria. Most of the others failed in some way to exhibit effective communication.</p> 

<p>My next piece of evidence is a learning activity completed for LIBR 250: Design and Implementation of Instructional Strategies for Information Professionals. In this assignment we were asked to determine how our instructional design would be evaluated and how we would deliver the evaluation form. I developed six questions targeting three different criteria of my training program, namely the delivery format, the learning materials, and skill retention. Formative evaluation questions such as the ones I have provided tell the designer how well the program performed and whether it met its stated goals. They also help the program director or designer validate the need for such a training session.</p>

<p>The last piece of evidence is a compilation of two evaluation forms that I have created in my job at a private law firm. In addition to performing conflict of interest research, I am also the coordinator for Continuing Legal Education (CLE) in my office. The California State Bar Association requires that all participants in CLE programs be offered the opportunity to give feedback. Since our office is not just a consumer of CLE materials, but also a provider of them, I have created two different evaluation forms, one for online programs and the other for live classroom programs. These forms permit the participants to rate their experiences based on several criteria such as personal satisfaction, learning environment, content usefulness, training materials, and teacher effectiveness. The results of these evaluation surveys are compiled for record-keeping purposes; a copy of the ratings is sent to the instructor so that he or she may determine how best to improve the program.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have proved through reflective discussion posts, a learning activity, and first-hand experience that I understand how to structure and build evaluation methodologies and how to properly evaluate both services and programs according to specific criteria. I am aware of and can use professional guidelines to produce evaluation criteria. My ability to perform evaluations will serve me well as a future librarian. </p>
