<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>As I have reiterated throughout this portfolio, the job of a librarian is to connect users with the information they seek. In order to perform this function, a librarian must have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of information-seeking behaviors. Information professionals rely on their knowledge of how users approach and complete the information search process to perform many different tasks, including structuring a rewarding reference interview and designing useful retrieval systems.</p> 

<p>Several researchers have contributed to the body of work on information-seeking behaviors, among them Kuhlthau and Marchionini. In one of Kuhlthau's most well-known papers, she explains the six stages of the information search process (ISP). Kuhlthau (1991) defines the ISP as "the user's constructive activity of finding meaning from information in order to extend his or her state of knowledge on a particular problem or topic" (p. 361). In her user-centered approach, she emphasizes that feelings of uncertainty and anxiety permeate much of the process. Each user passes through the six stages in three distinct ways: physically, affectively and cognitively. The first stage, initiation, is where the user recognizes the need for information. In the second stage, selection, the user identifies the broad research topic and chooses the approach and techniques to use. Exploration, the third stage, involves the review of background information on the general topic to increase the user's understanding. The fourth stage, formulation, is the turning point, where the user develops a topical focus for the search. In stage five, collection, the user gathers information that supports the narrowed focus. Finally, in the sixth stage, the user finishes the search and prepares the results for use.</p>

<p>Marchionini (1997) builds on Kuhlthau's user-driven focus by differentiating two search strategies: analytical and browsing. An analytical search strategy requires the user to plan ahead, to remember and reuse search terms, and to rework search queries when results are not up to par. In contrast, a browsing strategy requires no advance planning or methodical searching and instead relies on opportunistic searching and the ability to recognize relevant results when they are found. Marchionini (1997) claims that users are more inclined to browse even though analytical searching is often more efficient (p. 8).</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>The first piece of evidence that I am submitting is a review of an information retrieval system I wrote for LIBR 202: Information Retrieval. The review and evaluation of the IRS I chose, CapitalIQ, involved multiple steps, but most important for this competency is the user testing of the database on pages 7 and 8. As shown through the survey responses from the three testers, there was a high level of anxiety and a lack of confidence plaguing the bulk of the search process. Through the work of the more advanced users, I also learned how important stages two and four of ISP are. Narrowing down the focus of the search was necessary in order to answer the detailed questions. Likewise, both of the more advanced searchers had to choose a search strategy appropriate to each question, and in most cases found that they had to rework those queries to get the correct answer, just as Marchionini concluded that analytical searchers would do. If I was surveying my participants today, I would ask additional questions related to each stage of search process to better understand how each user acted, thought and felt.</p>

<p>My second piece of evidence is a series of discussion posts written for LIBR 285: Research Methods in Library and Information Science. These posts articulate my thought process as a researcher, and they display my personal experience with all six stages of the information search process. Identifying my information need and selecting a topic and historical treatment brought me a lot of anxiety and led me to ask my fellow classmates for guidance on choosing a direction. I explored my topic through several background sources, including bibliographies and encyclopedias. In the fourth stage, I began to narrow my focus and formulate my hypothesis with the help of book reviews and a review of existing literature on the topic. Next, I sought out specific collections of primary materials that were on point and available for research purposes. Finally, I evaluated the success of my research and reflected on the difficulties I was having trying to translate all of my work into a coherent outline for presentation. My reflections on the research process are evidence of my first-hand knowledge of the difficulties that users encounter throughout the ISP.</p> 

<p>Lastly, I include a discussion post on the importance of browsing that I wrote for LIBR 220: Resources and Information Services. I explain in the post that browsing is useful, but only if the user is beyond stage one and has already determined the information need. Once the user has a topic in mind, browsing can be the catalyst that moves the research from stage two to stage four, which is the turning point of the process. Since most of the user's anxiety is experienced in the first three stages, getting a serendipitous boost from a browsing strategy may help lessen the apprehensions.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have shown through three pieces of evidence that I can articulate several components of information-seeking behaviors, including Kuhlthau's six stages of the information search process and Marchionini's designations of analytical and browsing search strategies. My understanding of these basic, fundamental theories will be put to practical use when I interact with patrons who are experiencing anxiety while seeking the answers they need.</p>
