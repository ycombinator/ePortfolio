<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Communications skills are important for any interpersonal relationship, whether private or professional. As a librarian, I will need to hone my oral communication skills if I want to have effective interactions with my patrons and colleagues. By speaking clearly and concisely and with an organized pattern to my thoughts, I can help reduce misunderstandings and ease doubts. I may also be able to persuade some to adopt my ideas. Written communication is just as important, whether it be in the form of an emailed response to a reference question or a formal proposal directed to upper management. Strong and effective written communication requires good grammar and a fluid writing style. Good communication skills are especially important in group projects. As librarianship is largely a collaborative field, librarians must know how and be willing to work with others to further their own professional goals and those of the institutions they serve.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>The first four pieces of evidence listed below work together to demonstrate my abilities to collaborate on a group project using written and oral communication and to produce professional-level audio and textual materials. For the final project of LIBR 247: Vocabulary Design, my group members* and I formed a mock committee to create a proposal for a new metadata schema and photo database for a real-life association, the Society of American Travel Writers (SATW). We used Google Docs and Elluminate conferences to cooperatively work on each piece of the proposal. The first document listed below is an example of one of our Google Docs. Each font color represents a different author (my contributions are found in red). As we neared the project completion, we began crossing things off the outline and highlighting what remained to be done. In six different Elluminate sessions, lasting several hours each, we were able to fine-tune our proposal. A brief clip of one of these Elluminate sessions is my second piece of evidence; it illustrates my oral communication skills and my willingness to defer to more knowledgeable team members, all while keeping a good humor (my voice is the first heard). The end product of our collaborative efforts is the third document on the list, our metadata design proposal. Although written as a school assignment, the paper is meant to be seen as a professional pitch to the directors of the SATW. My solo work on the written portion included the requirements analysis and technical report; numerous other sections were written as true collaborations by all group members. The fourth piece of evidence is the oral presentation that our mock committee gave to discuss the progress on our proposal. The audience for the presentation was assumed to be information professionals. My oral communication skills are apparent from watching the clip. Using input from my fellow group members, I also created the PowerPoint slides that accompanied the presentation.</p>

<p>Next, I submit a genuine professional proposal as further evidence of my written communication skills. The document is a memorandum I drafted to the office manager at my place of employment which confirms the details of the formal library internship I had proposed. Names have been redacted where necessary, although my supervisor, Joanne, gave permission for the use of her name. The memo proves my ability to write with a professional tone and displays my attention to detail. My text restates the parameters of the internship clearly. I also include a list of attachments in support of my proposal. The memorandum was well-received by my boss, and my internship was approved.</p> 

<p>My last piece of evidence is an example of a professional-level audio presentation I made for LIBR 247: Vocabulary Design. The assignment asked us to interview an information professional who had designed or created a controlled vocabulary or classification system. I created a detailed PowerPoint presentation, complete with screenshots and images that supported my commentary. I used the pointer tool in the Elluminate display window to help the audience follow along with my presentation. I created a script for each slide to minimize stuttering and help keep my thoughts coherent. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have had the fortunate opportunity to work on several group projects during my time in the SLIS program. I chose the Metadata Design project because it best demonstrates my strong verbal collaboration skills and my ability to create professional-level work. I have also proven my mastery of this competency through two solo projects that showcase my communication skills. These projects prove that I can communicate effectively, both in collaborative and professional environments. </p>
