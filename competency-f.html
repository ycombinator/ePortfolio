<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Collection development and collection management are vital skills for any librarian. The two principle factors affecting print collections are the physical space they require and the audience for whom they are intended. Creation of new collections requires dedicated storage space, and selection of materials requires knowledge of the patron base. Evaluation of a print collection involves usage statistics for each item and the weeding out of unused items that are taking up precious shelf space. Acquisition of materials into the permanent collection requires budget latitude, but collections can also be temporarily bolstered through loan programs. Protecting and preserving a print collection calls for efforts to maximize access while minimizing direct contact with fragile volumes. The organization of a print collection is typically based on the physical space and is done in an effort to collocate similar subjects. Digital collections are constrained less by physical space and more by disk space. Additionally, cost is a major factor in the development of digital collections. Subscriptions to electronic journals and large e-journal databases are 
often prohibitively expensive for libraries. They also run the risk of losing the archived content if the database is discontinued or the library must cancel its contract.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>
The bulk of my evidence in support of this competency comes from the Final Report I wrote for LIBR 294: Professional Experience - Internships. Two of my learning outcomes were directly related to collection management, and I was able to gain quite a bit of hands-on experience with every aspect of Competency F.  To begin, I was able to practice creating a new collection by selecting a set of recommended resources for new associates. As seen in Appendix B of the report, I culled together a list of vetted resources, both electronic and print, on a variety of topics that would be most useful to new attorneys. The topics were chosen based on the practice areas of the law firm, and the sources were selected based on the advice of librarians and field experts. The beauty of this new collection is that it is formed from materials already found in the firm's library; they have simply been regrouped in such a way to make them more useful and easier to find when a topical question arises.</p> 

<p>As the firm's shelf space was incredibly limited, Joanne Scala (the firm's librarian) faced a constant need to evaluate the print collection. She tracked usage loosely by asking that attorneys ask her to fetch books for them. Items that were infrequently used were noted down and permission was sought from the corporate headquarters to dispose of them. Joanne told me that she suspected that several volumes of two different titles were going unused. In the first case (see p. 6), we observed that the older edits to securities laws were never touched (and had gathered quite a bit of dust). On Joanne's urging, I pulled several of the <em>Federal Securities Law Reporter</em> transfer binders, dating back nearly a decade, off the shelf. Once the head librarian had granted permission, Joanne asked me to dismantle the binders and recycle the contents. The second case was trickier. The firm maintained a print subscription to the California state code. These books, numbering in the hundreds, took up eight shelves. Joanne had been monitoring usage, and found that while some of the volumes did get used, the frequency was low. Although no resolution was made before the end of my internship, I was able to confirm with Joanne after the fact, that her reasoning was sound. With the approval of the firm's head librarian, she canceled the print subscription in favor of an electronic one (through Lexis) and donated the volumes to a local library. I learned that evaluating a collection for the purpose of weeding is a weighty responsibility. There is bound to be a patron who is dissatisfied with a weeding decision. Hopefully, as I will discuss next, the librarian will be able to help the patron acquire the material he seeks through other means.</p>

<p>Acquisitioning is the next aspect of collection management that I learned about through my internship. One of the easiest ways to satisfy a short-term need for a material is through an inter-library loan (ILL). Many local and academic libraries belong to consortiums that have an agreement to share materials. These networks are invaluable to the patron needing a book not available at her local branch library. Likewise, the firm where I interned was networked in several ways to give and receive ILLs. Joanne used her memberships in several local law librarian associations to seek ILLs, and she also secured borrowing privileges from the Stanford University Law Library. Pages 15 to 17 and Appendix 
C of my internship report explain in detail how I used the email listserv of one local association to foster goodwill by offering a book to a local firm and also to seek out two volumes that our firm needed on a short-term basis. Longer-term needs typically required a permanent addition to the firm's collection. I assisted Joanne by acquiring one law review article from an obscure publisher in Pennsylvania (p. 18), and attempted to locate and secure another article from a foreign publisher, but was unsuccessful because the article did not exist (p. 17). </p>

<p>I spent several weeks assisting Joanne in her efforts to organize her collection. Due to the dispersed nature of the shelving, a conventional classification system was not practical. Joanne and I discussed the options and determined that a color-coded spine label system was a better choice. Joanne ordered the labeling supplies, and I created the colored labels using abbreviations to indicate the shelf location ("1W" = first floor, west wing). Next, we chose the topical arrangement of the shelves. For example, one section held corporate practice materials on securities, mergers, statutes, accounting rules and patent information. I then affixed the labels to the spines of each volume in the given section (pp. 6-7). Subject classification or organization is most common in libraries, and it allows for serendipitous finds through browsing. In a series of discussion posts for LIBR 210: Reference and Information Services, I 
weigh the costs and benefits of moving reference materials out of a reference collection and into the circulating collection. In this particular case, those needing to browse by subject would gain by having the topical reference materials on the same shelves as other related books, but those looking for vetted, reliable answers would no longer have the confidence that a known reference material would provide.</p>

<p>My experience with the preservation of materials is proved through two pieces of evidence. The first is a research paper I wrote for LIBR 200: Information and Society about the role libraries play in the preservation of cultural materials. My research on the topic centered primarily on the most common challenges libraries around the world face while trying to preserve and protect documentary heritage. These challenges include natural disasters, such as floods and fires, inadequate resources or poor preservation skills that lead to abysmal storage conditions, social unrest or violence that make some cultural materials vulnerable to destruction, and technological changes that make ongoing access and preservation nearly impossible. I grew to have a greater appreciation for ancestral written works that have survived despite these enormous obstacles. The second piece of evidence is a wiki I created for LIBR 280: History of Books and Libraries which showcases my work with two preserved volumes, one a 15th century hand-written Book of Hours and the other an early printed edition of a work by Herodotus. As described in the introductions to both sections, access to these books was restricted by the Stanford Special Collections library. In an effort to preserve the books, I was required to submit a paging request to bring them from off-site storage, complete a visitor's application and provide identification, and leave all potentially-damaging articles (like ink pens) outside the reading room. My request to photograph the Book of Hours manuscript was denied to preserve the fragile binding. For both volumes, I was asked to use a foam book-rest and cotton-covered weights (called "snakes") to prop the books open so as to minimize the contact my fingers made with the pages. My experience with these rare books is evidence that I can take basic precautions to preserve physical collections, especially those of a delicate nature.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Through my extensive hands-on experience, reflective discussion posts and topical research, I have shown that I can use the basic concepts and principles related to the creation, evaluation, selection, acquisition, preservation and organization of information collections. I really enjoyed helping to manage the law firm's print collection and look forward to doing similar work as a full-time librarian.
