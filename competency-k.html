<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Learning theories can be broken down into three primary models: behaviorist, cognitive, and humanist. The behaviorist model focuses on observable behavior and encourages immediate feedback. Those who ascribe to this theory believe that active participation by the student is crucial for learning. They also believe that learners should be subjected to periodic tests at each stage of training. The cognitive model claims that learning occurs through the student's perceptions of his environment and the identification of patterns within that environment. A branch of the cognitive model, known as constructivism, takes this idea further; constructivists believe that discrepancies between a learner's mental model of the world and the actual world prompt learning and lead to the development of more complex mental models. Teachers in the cognitive model are viewed as catalysts; lectures should be minimized or eliminated, and students should be given the opportunity to experiment with the new material. The last school of thought, humanism, purports that feelings are just as important as thoughts, so the learning environment should be comfortable, and basic needs should be met. The content being taught must have personal meaning for the learner, or it will not be learned. Finally, humanists believe that instruction should be learner-centered and designed for the intrinsically-motivated learner. </p> 

<p>Although it may seem that each learning model is patently different from the others, they do, in fact, share some common ground. Both the behaviorist and cognitive models emphasize the importance of active participation by the learner. Behaviorists and humanists agree that students must be ready before moving on to each new stage of learning. Humanists and constructivists both recognize the need for personal meaning in the learning process. To design a successful training program, instructors must take these three schools of thought and combine them into a coherent formula. As Grassian and Kaplowitz (2009) put it, information literacy instructors should "mix and match from all three models to create the most effective instructional environment possible" (p. 45). The most important thing to remember when designing a training course is to keep the focus on the learner and to acknowledge that not all people learn the same.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>My first piece of evidence is a series of discussion posts and responses I wrote for LIBR 210: Reference and Information Services. The professor's prompts dealt with information literacy instruction. I chose to respond to an article on the learning behaviors of adult library patrons. I learned that adult students need to know why the information is important, necessary or applicable to them, just as the humanist and cognitive learning models have shown. Adult learners can be strongly motivated if they see a benefit to the instruction. In another post in response to classmate's comments, I explain that encouraging active participation from a patron is the best way to teach when the individual is unaware of his/her own shortcomings. Finally, I provide first-hand experience in another response post when it comes to training learners from different language and cultural backgrounds. Instructors must be aware of the cultural cues that impact a learner's involvement in the course and should be prepared to alter the instructional design to accommodate these behaviors.</p>

<p>The next assignment I have listed below is an instructional design plan I created for LIBR 250: Design and Implementation of Instructional Strategies for Information Professionals. This plan is evidence that I can use appropriate learning theories to construct a training session in an information literacy setting. I proposed to redesign an existing training session at the law firm where I work. The learning audience would be made up of administrative assistance. I conducted a needs assessment and examined entry behaviors and learner characteristics to determine which skills I would need to cover in the session and which skills I could assume the learners already possessed. The combination of these design principles ensured that my instructional plan would be learner-centric. The needs assessment showed that the previous method of non-stop lecturing was not a good fit, and to conform to the constructivist model, I opted to eliminate the lecture component from my training design. Instead, I opted to allow the learners to manipulate the mouse as I explained the process, and I added a test run at the conclusion of the training. Working together, these two pieces form the bulk of the training session and encourage active participation according to the behaviorist model. The humanist model is accounted for by the learner's desire to excel at her job, thereby allowing her to find strong personal meaning in the learning process. The influence of the humanist model is also found in the choice of location, a small training room where each learner has her own personal computer and space to take notes. My design incorporates plans to help the learner retain the newly-acquired knowledge through the use of a learning object (reference guide), immediate feedback (gentle correction during the initial training), and a test run followed by assessment. Finally, I demonstrate the importance of making sure the training is meeting the needs of the learners by employing a formative assessment conducted via email.</p> 

<p>Lastly, I provide an essay describing a training session that I routinely conduct in my current employment as evidence of my ability to design instructional programs using learning theories. This particular training is provided to new legal assistants to show them how to conduct a conflict search from start to finish. For confidentiality reasons, I cannot provide recordings or screen shots of the training materials; instead, I have written a summary of how and why I made the choices I did when designing the course. My initial lesson plan required quite a bit of alteration after I realized that my primary learners were coming from a high context society where asking questions and active participation are looked down on in the learning experience. I used this learning theory to incorporate several new design principles, specifically a big-picture introduction and a group training approach (as opposed to one-on-one).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Through my reflective discussion posts, my instructional design plan, and my work experience, I have proved that I know, understand and can apply learning theories and principles to design effective and engaging training programs. I expect that this skill will be well-used in my career as an information professional. </p>
