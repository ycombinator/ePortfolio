<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>The success of any library program is directly tied to the efforts and skills of those managing the project. Proper planning must be completed to ensure that requirements are adequately addressed. Resources must be organized and managed so that the project is sufficiently funded with person-hours and financing. Targeted marketing is vital to make certain that the intended audience knows about the program and will benefit from it. By not taking the time to focus on these three facets of project management, the library is dooming that project to failure, whether by ignoring a pressing need, understaffing a project, or debuting to little public interest. A failed program is a black mark on a library's reputation and may affect the institution's ability to secure funding, volunteers or other forms of support in the future. 
</p>
 

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>My first piece of evidence shows my understanding of the fundamental principles involved in organizational planning. It is an Elluminate presentation of a group* project for LIBR 204: Information Organizations and Management. The project required us to create a strategic plan for an existing library. My team chose the University of Texas, Austin library system. My portion of the project included interviewing an administrator and drafting the historical background, editing and creating graphics for the budget section, and condensing more than thirty written pages into the PowerPoint slides used in our public presentation. Although each team member was designated with certain tasks, we all read and reviewed each section to assure our full understanding of the plan. Our work was thorough; I would not make any changes to the content or direction. As demonstrated through our presentation, I learned that planning can be a complex process, but it is imperative that it be carried out to the fullest extent so that progress toward the desired outcome does not stall. My work on UT Austin's plan taught me the importance of conducting an environmental scan, which shows who the interested parties are (such as competitors, external partners or a parent institution) and how the library interacts with them. With the data gathered from a scan, a SWOT analysis can be used to determine exactly what an institution's capabilities are and where there is room for improvement. Well-executed environmental scans and SWOT analyses will lead to the creation of achievable and measurable goals.</p>  

<p>I performed another crucial part of the planning process - needs assessment - for LIBR 250: Design and Implementation of Instructional Strategies for Information Professionals. Completed just a semester ago, I was able to use all of my MLIS knowledge to complete this assignment, which asked us to evaluate the needs of a library within the context of instructional design. Although not quite the same scope as a library system strategic plan, performing this needs assessment was just as vital to the success of the training program as it would be for a much larger project. I demonstrate through this assignment that I understand the importance of screening for redundant training efforts and identifying environment-specific requirements before embarking on a new project. </p>

<p>Intelligent management of resources, both financial and staffing-related, is necessary for a project's success. In an essay I wrote for LIBR 204: Information Organizations and Management, I learned how limited resources can restrain a project and mismanaged resources can doom one. I interviewed a corporate records manager and a special collections librarian on their experiences with planning for and introducing a technological change. I discovered through my conversations with them that implementing a new project requires people, not just funds. In both case studies, committees were formed to assist with planning, but more importantly, to help vet the new software. Data transitions and data clean-up required a full-time staff member or the equivalent person-hours. If I were given the opportunity to speak with these individuals again, I would ask for more details about how the committee members and staff members were chosen for their roles. Should I find myself in a position to manage a project, I will need to make sure that enough staff is dedicated to the project and that those chosen have the appropriate skill set. Proper management of the human element will prevent burnout, overextension and costly delays.</p>

<p>My last piece of evidence shows my ability to apply the concepts of marketing and advocacy to library programs. Written for LIBR 204: Information Organizations and Management, this short essay examines the marketing materials used to advertise programs offered at one local library. I visited the library's main branch in person and perused its website to learn how it marketed its various events and programs. I analyzed the colorful flyers, sleek bookmarks and oversized signs that notified patrons about important dates, presentations and happenings. I reviewed the blogs, calendars, and social networking tools available on the library website. I determined that these marketing methods were best suited to the clientele the library hoped to serve with its programs. If I was completing this assignment today, I would do further research to determine if the library made any paid advertisements in local news outlets to attract new patrons, especially since one of the audiences I felt was overlooked (college-aged students and young professionals) may not view the information anywhere else.</p> 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have proven through the four pieces of evidence included here that I can apply the fundamental principles of planning, management, and marketing. I know how to perform environmental scans and needs assessments, juggle human resources to staff a project and target marketing materials to advertise programs and attract new patrons. Some librarians would claim planning, management and marketing are the "business-side" of the profession and handled by a relatively small percentage of us. While this supposition may be true in part, I believe that my proficiency with these skills will help me be a better information professional by allowing me to develop successful programs that reach their intended audiences.</p>
