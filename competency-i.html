<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>For those of us looking to work with library patrons, whether virtually or in-person, necessity will require that we spend significant time on reference services. There are certainly differences between providing assistance from a reference desk in a public library and fielding research questions via email or chat, but it is more important to note the similarities. In order to provide accurate and relevant access to the desired information, librarians must conduct a reference interview to get to know the patron's needs. Librarians also must be familiar with the breadth of material available from their institutions so they can make recommendations that match up with the patron's expectations. Librarians also must learn to anticipate the most common information needs of their users and take proactive steps to provide this information as quickly as possible. Finally, reference services for individuals or groups of users should aim to make these users more self-sufficient in their information seeking by educating them on how to use library resources. A competent reference librarian knows how to distill down to the user's primary question, what information is available to answer that question, and how best to present the information so that the user will reap maximum benefit.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>My first piece of evidence displays my understanding of perhaps the most important aspect of reference services: good communication. In the reflective essay I wrote for LIBR 210: Reference and Information Services, I explain how important it is to give the patron one's full attention, to use verbal cues to prompt additional details and to be sure not to interrupt the patron while she explains her needs. The essay also goes on to show that I am familiar with how body language can derail an otherwise productive reference experience. A reference librarian should seem approachable and willing to help and should not appear distracted or bothered. If I was writing this essay today, especially after completing my law library internship, I would include additional insight from interaction with patrons, especially those that happened virtually. My work here demonstrates my ability to conduct a proper reference interview. By asking questions, prompting for details and refraining from making assumptions, I will be able to ascertain what information is relevant for the user and how best to provide access to it. Once I begin working on a request, I will need to keep the patron apprised of my progress, and at the conclusion of the interaction, I should make certain the patron knows with whom to follow up if further questions arise.</p> 

<p>Linking users with information can be a complex task, especially with so many different reference sources to consider. The second piece of evidence listed below shows my competency with providing access to a variety of material, especially when the user's individual preferences (electronic, print, Internet, etc.) are unknown. In the final research assignment for LIBR 210: Reference and Information Services, I was asked to respond to two email reference questions. My work on these questions shows my thoughtful consideration of the question not just through the vetted sources I recommend, but also through the detailed annotations I provide about each source. The patron now has everything he needs at his fingertips, including instructions on how to access the required information. My responses list free websites, printed books in the library catalog and from inter-library loan, and electronic journal articles and databases; the information I provide is very thorough, and my presentation of the electronic reference interview is well-made. I would not make any changes to this assignment. </p>

<p>Next, I provide evidence of my ability to both anticipate patron's information needs and offer reliable, accurate sources to meet those needs. To create a pathfinder for LIBR 220: Resources and Information Services - Legal Resources, I had to rely on the cumulative knowledge I gained about legal reference sources. I vetted the sources, making sure each was current and accurate. If interpretations were given, I made sure that the underlying laws were still valid. The pathfinder's topic, national origin discrimination in the workplace, could be a common research topic in public law libraries in diverse communities. By creating a pathfinder that collocates state, federal, statutory, administrative and case law all in one place, I have given a patron with a sensitive and distressing problem a place to begin his research. He can be confident in the sources because the librarian has approved them. Access to the materials is made easy through hyperlinks and formal citations. The narrow subject of the pathfinder ensures that the patron will find something of relevance to help with his claim. Most of all, the patron will save time and energy because the librarian anticipated his need and took the steps to preemptively answer his questions in a non-confrontational manner.</p>

<p>Lastly, I include evidence that I created during my internship, LIBR 294. The PowerPoint presentation is part of an in-person orientation that is given to groups of new attorneys when they are hired on at the firm. The slides are meant to serve as a "Library 101" crash course; the content helps users know what information is available to them, where to find it, and how to access it. The training session is designed to be an overview of library services and is not intended delve into any one reference source too deeply. As many new attorneys share the same questions and concerns about information access, they significantly benefit from the dynamics of a group presentation. A significant part of reference is teaching patrons how to use the library for themselves, and this presentation shows that I can offer reference training at the group level.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have proved through three pieces of evidence that I can ascertain a patron's needs, recommend and provide access to a wide variety of relevant resources, and properly vet reference sources to ensure their reliability and accuracy. Patrons who seek help at a reference desk are depending on a librarian to get them to the right information quickly. Through my coursework, I have learned the techniques and skills that will allow me to suitably fulfill this role.</p>
