<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Most libraries today pride themselves on being on the cutting edge of information technologies, specifically those engineered for networking, communicating and educating. Library websites have become interactive spaces for patrons. Through widgets and APIs, libraries can link their users to information all over the Internet from one central hub. Networking and advocacy are furthered through online social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter. Special libraries are using corporate methods of distance communication such as Skype and GoToMeeting to conduct training sessions. Libraries looking to educate their patrons have found an overabundance of technologies, many of them freeware or open-source products that are easy on the budget. Libraries are still in the business of disseminating information, but now they are doing so outside their brick-and-mortar walls by using information and communication technologies.</p>

<h2>Evidence</h2>



<p>My first piece of evidence is a screenshot of my Facebook profile. I use the ubiquitous tool to keep in touch with friends and family, but even more, I use it to network with my school classmates, former professors, work colleagues, and 
fellow members of local associations. Facebook is a fantastic tool for networking and advocacy. Events can be broadcast and advertised to a wide audience, support for special causes can be raised, and interest in an organization can be engendered. I closely follow the notices posted by SJSU SLIS and my local law library association, watching for opportunities to get involved. These two groups are excellent examples of how a library can use a platform like Facebook to increase its profile in the community.</p> 

<p>The second item I have put forth as evidence is a wiki I created for LIBR 280: History of Books and Libraries. I used a wiki template from Wikidot. For those in the library field who have some working knowledge of HTML, wiki templates are a great way for us to generate an educational site on a specific theme. In this case, I described and analyzed two rare books, one a religious manuscript and the other a 16th century printing of a book written by Herodotus. I was able to use photos and diagrams to support the written materials, making for a more engaging learning experience. The wiki format can be an excellent learning tool for libraries to use, especially if the design is open to additions and comments by community users. Wikis can form the backbone of a traditional course or be used more for ongoing reference needs. As I have encouraged in my own wiki, interaction between the creator and the reader using wiki technology breathes life into stale material and provides a more well-rounded perspective. </p>

<p>The next piece of evidence is a screencast I created for my law firm employer. The trainings I conduct in my office are typically done synchronously, sometimes in person and sometimes using GoToMeeting (a desktop-sharing conferencing software). Because of the confidential nature of the examples I use in my training, I cannot provide evidence of my GoToMeeting recordings. Instead, I have shown my ability to use another software for training purposes. My supervisors are currently considering the option to make part of the training asynchronous. The screencast demonstration I have provided is one experiment I have made with a training video using a freeware called Wink. There is no audio accompaniment at this point, but an audio track may be added at a later date. In place of audio instructions, I have included text boxes with anecdotal pointers for users new to the conflict search request form.</p>

<p>Another training technology that can be used to increase interaction in asynchronous formats is the Quia Quizzes website. My last piece of evidence is a screenshot of my user profile, including the quizzes I have created, and a sample of one of my quizzes. I created these quizzes for LIBR 280: History of Books and Libraries. The Quia site allows teachers to choose from a variety of different quiz templates, including flashcards, matching, battleship, jumbled words, and hangman. I used material in my 280 class to create six different activities, each on a different topic. Quia's site requires a subscription, but once inside, educators can create their own activities or browse the millions of activities created by other teachers from around the world. Quia builds a learning community, and my quizzes are now a part of that.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Information is spread with the click of a button. As a librarian, I need to know how to make those clicks work for me. I have shown through my evidence that I am able to effectively use information and communication technologies to network, educate and train. As I step into a formal librarian role, I will keep my eyes and ears open for emerging technologies and tools that can help me better perform my essential job functions.</p>
